# Collecting the assignments

Depending on the infrastructure there are various ways for collecting the completed assignments from the students. Email can be one or a folder on shared network drive. You can also ask students to push their assignments into Github or similar.

# Processing the assignments

Here we assume that you have gathered the assigments on **importing data** into a folder `~/rcourse/completed_assignments/import/` and each students assignment has a unique file name. The folder structure here is:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
~
└─── rcourse
    |─── completed_assignments
    |                      └───basics
    |                      └───import
    |                              └─── student_x_import.R
    |                              └─── student_y_import.R
    |                              └─── student_z_import.R
    └─── assignment_summaries
                        └─── summary_import.R
```

We could then call the function `process_assignments()` with following values for attributes in order to get the file  `~/rcourse/assignment_summaries/summary_import.R`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
edu::process_assignments(path_assignments = "~/rcourse/completed_assignments/import/", 
                         outfile_name = "summary_import", 
                         outfile_path = "~/rcourse/assignment_summaries/")
```


See the gif-image below for the process:

# Distributing the summary

Once the summary is processed, you can either distribute the resulting R-script or you can render it into a html-file using `rmarkdown::render()`. If you want chunk of answers to be evaluated, replace the `eval = FALSE` with `eval = TRUE`. But remember to review the answers before for any security concerns!
