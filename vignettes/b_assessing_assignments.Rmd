# Collecting the assignments

Depending on the infrastructure there are various ways for collecting the completed assignments from the students. Email can be one or a folder on shared network drive. You can also ask students to push their assignments into Github or similar.

# Processing the assignments

Here we assume that you have gathered the assigments on **importing data** into a folder `~/rcourse/completed_assignments/week_1/` and each students assignment has a unique file name. The folder structure here is:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
~
└─── rcourse
    |─── assingment_templates
    |                      └─── week_1.R
    |─── completed_assignments
    |                      └───week_1
    |                      |      └─── student_x_week_1.R
    |                      |      └─── student_y_week_1.R
    |                      |      └─── student_z_week_1.R
    |                      └─── week_2
    |                      └─── week_3
    └─── summaries
                └─── summary_week_1.R
```

We could then call the function `process_assignments()` with following values for attributes in order to get the file  `~/rcourse/summaries/summary_week_1.R`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
edu::process_assignments(path_assignments = "~/rcourse/completed_assignments/week_1/", 
                         outfile_name = "summary_week_1", 
                         outfile_path = "~/rcourse/summaries/")
```


See the gif-image below for the process:




# Distributing the summary

Once the summary is processed, you can either distribute the resulting R-script or you can render it into a html-file using `rmarkdown::render()`. If you want chunk of answers to be evaluated, replace the `eval = FALSE` with `eval = TRUE`. But remember to review the answers before for any security concerns!
