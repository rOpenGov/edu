# Creating an assessment

Assuming that you have installed the `edu`-package and that you are happy with the current state of exercises provided by the yml-files in `data/`-folder, you can create a new assignment by:

1. creating a new R-script (`Ctrl+Shift+n`)
2. selecting the *Create assignment* -addin from the **Addins** drop down menu
3. picking the language
4. picking the domain of your assignment, and 
5. individually picking the exercises by checking the boxes, and pressing **Done** in the end.

Addin then prints a generic yaml-header and for each exercise

- question between asterixes in language you selected
- unique chunk id with `eval = FALSE`
- default answer `replace_this_with_your_answer()`

Also, addin prints a first level heading `Correct answers` and repeats all the question with correct answers for own use. (Easier to assist the students when you have the correct answers at hand).

Remove the correct answers (you can save them somewhere) and save the assignment with default answers into regular R-script with a good name, `basic_assignments.R`


See the gif-image below for the process:



# Distributing assignments

There are several ways for distributing a R-script to your students. You can upload the file somewhere for students to download. If you have your students email addresses, packages like [mailR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mailR/index.html) and [sendmailR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sendmailR/index.html) can be used for sending mass emails with attachments.
